# Calculate-englacial-layer-continuity-from-airborne-radar
This folder contains a python code used in Fremand and Bodart et al. (2022; ESSD) to calculate englacial layer continuity along all published airborne radar data from British Antarctic Survey PASIN radar system

Details on ILCI methodology can be found in Karlsson et al. (2012, EPSL, doi: 10.1016/j.epsl.2012.04.034)

The code was written by J. Bodart (BAS/UoE) on 18/10/2021
